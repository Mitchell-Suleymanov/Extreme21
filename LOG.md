# Extreme21
An Extreme game of 21 (Based on the Resident Evil 7 minigame "Survival 21")

2-27-2019
Summary: Adding all files on here. I've been very busy working on this project for a few weeks now. So why this? Well it has been rough applying to jobs with no experience. I figured one way to show my skills would be to create my own side project. Out of all things, I chose to remake the Resident Evil 7 minigame "Survival 21" in Java.
This will look nowhere near as good as the console game does, but that isn't the point. The goal is to see if I can recreate it or not. While I am recreating it, I am putting in my own personal touch. I am adding in new Trump cards, renamed to Aces. I am also planning to add an EXP system and save function, but that is near the end of this project's life.

Objectives:
1. Integrate Aces into the game. They are coded but so far do nothing.
2. Add in more opponents. They will be: Knight, Bishop, Rook, King, Queen.
3. Add in pauses for the GUI to create suspense like in the game.
4. Add in Save function.
5. Add in EXP System.

Bugs:
- Label for opponent's hand is not revealed when match ends.
- Implemented delays do not work correctly. They have been removed until they are working as intended.
